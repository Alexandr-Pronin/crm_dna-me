# CloudFormation deployment plan for CRM project (2026-02-12 14:25Z)

_**User**_

Create a CloudFormation deployment plan for this CRM project focusing on high portability and minimal AWS lock-in for future migration to Proxmox/Manitou. Requirements: Use Postgres in a Docker container instead of AWS RDS; Use Nginx or Traefik as a reverse proxy instead of AWS ALB; No AWS Lambda or proprietary AWS services; Focus on MVP by omitting Redis and complex caching; Ensure no CloudFormation-specific logic exists in the application code; Use Docker Compose overrides for AWS deployment; Target region: eu-central-1. Provide a complete deployment plan including the CloudFormation YAML template and a list of created files.
